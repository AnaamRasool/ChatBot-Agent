## üöÄ How It Works

1. üìÇ **Upload a PDF or document** to your Google Drive.
2. üîÑ n8n workflow fetches the file using **Google Drive node**.
3. üß† The document is split into chunks using the **Recursive Character Text Splitter**.
4. üß¨ Each chunk is embedded using **Google Gemini Embeddings**.
5. üì• Embedded vectors are stored in **Pinecone** under a specific namespace.
6. üí¨ When a chat message is received, the **AI Agent**:
   - Uses **Simple Memory** for context.
   - Queries the **Pinecone Vector Store**.
   - Retrieves the most relevant chunks.
   - Uses **Gemini Chat Model** to generate an accurate, contextual response.

The agent uses a refined system prompt to interpret responses returned from vector tools naturally, without repeating them robotically. It answers like a human, maintaining context and flow.
